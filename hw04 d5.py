def cube(x):
    answer= x*x*x
    return answer

# a. This function's name is cube. x is its variable. The function returns cube of input x.



y=4
print(cube(y))

answer = 4
result = cube(3)
print(answer, result)

# The result is 4 27 because 4 is passed to variable answer. cube(3) is passed to variable result. cube(3) calls function cube(x)
# The input is 3 so cube(3) equals 27.
